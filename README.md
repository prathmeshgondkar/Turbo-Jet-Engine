# Turbojet Engine – CATIA V5 3D Model

This repository contains a fully modeled **Turbojet Engine** created using **CATIA V5**.  
The goal of this personal project was to demonstrate advanced CAD modeling, showcase design skills, and gain better insight into the structure of jet engines.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Strengthen 3D modeling and CAD skills in CATIA V5  
- Practice the geometry of multi-stage axial compressors and turbines  
- Apply mechanical design principles in a realistic yet assumed-dimension model

---

## 🔍 Overview

- **Software Used:** CATIA V5 (Part Design Workbench)  
- **Tools Applied:** Pad, Shaft, Rib, Sketch, Circular Pattern, Axis System  
- **Model Structure:** Fan → Compressor → Combustion (represented) → Turbine → Exhaust  
- **Model Type:** Single `.CATPart` file with multibody design  
- **Design Basis:** Assumed proportions and dimensions for educational purposes
